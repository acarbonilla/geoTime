# TeamLeaderScheduleReport Nightshift Enhancements

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to `frontend/src/TeamLeader_Report/TeamLeaderScheduleReport.js` to align with the current state of `ScheduleReport.js` regarding nightshift display and Duration column handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Duration Column
- **Removed Duration column header** from the table
- **Removed Duration column** from the table body
- **Removed Duration column** from CSV export headers
- **Removed Duration column** from CSV export data

### 2. Removed calculateNightshiftDuration Function
- **Deleted the entire `calculateNightshiftDuration` function** that was calculating nightshift durations
- **Removed all references** to this function throughout the code

### 3. Disabled Nightshift Grouping
- **Simplified `getGroupedRecordsForExport` function** to return records without grouping
- **Removed complex nightshift detection and grouping logic**
- **Each day now appears on a separate row** (ungrouped display)

### 4. Removed calculatedDuration References
- **Removed `calculatedDuration` property** from combined nightshift records
- **Updated console.log statements** to remove duration references
- **Cleaned up grouping logic** to focus on ungrouped display

## Current Behavior
- **No Duration column** in the table (BH column remains for break hours)
- **Nightshifts are displayed ungrouped** - each day appears on its own row
- **CSV export** no longer includes Duration column
- **Simplified data structure** without complex nightshift grouping

## Technical Details
- The `getGroupedRecordsForExport` function now simply returns the input records array without modification
- All nightshift-specific display logic has been removed
- The table structure has been updated to reflect the removal of the Duration column
- CSV export functionality has been updated to exclude Duration data

## Alignment with ScheduleReport.js
These changes ensure that `TeamLeaderScheduleReport.js` now matches the current state of `ScheduleReport.js`:
- Both components no longer display a Duration column
- Both components show nightshifts as ungrouped, individual rows
- Both components have simplified nightshift handling logic

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/TeamLeader_Report/TeamLeaderScheduleReport.js`

## Date of Changes
- December 2024

## Notes
- These changes reflect user feedback that preferred the ungrouped display for nightshifts
- The Duration column was considered redundant with the existing BH (Break Hours) column
- The simplified approach provides clearer, more straightforward data presentation
