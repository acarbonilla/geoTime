# View Toggle Feature

## Overview
The View Toggle feature allows users to switch between **Mobile View** and **Full Features** modes, providing flexibility in how they interact with the GeoTime application.

## How It Works

### Default Behavior
- **Mobile devices** → **Mobile View** by default
- **Desktop devices** → **Full Features** by default
- **User preference** overrides device detection (only on mobile/tablet)

### User Control
Users can manually switch between views using the toggle button in the user dropdown menu (only on mobile/tablet):
- **Mobile View**: Simplified interface with clock in/out and map
- **Full Features**: Complete dashboard with all functionality
- **Desktop/Laptop**: Always shows full features (no toggle available)

### Navigation Behavior
- **Mobile View**: No navbar, simplified interface with menu
- **Full View**: Full navbar with all navigation options
- **Toggle**: Smooth navigation between views without page reload

## Implementation

### Key Files
- `src/utils/deviceDetection.js` - Device detection and view mode logic
- `src/components/ViewToggle.js` - Toggle component with navigation
- `src/dashboards/MobileDashboard/MobileDashboard.js` - Mobile interface
- `src/App.js` - Routing logic based on view mode
- `src/Navbar.js` - Navigation bar with user dropdown toggle

### View Modes
```javascript
VIEW_MODES = {
  MOBILE: 'mobile',  // Simplified mobile interface
  FULL: 'full'       // Complete desktop interface
}
```

### User Preference Storage
- Uses `localStorage` to remember user choice
- Key: `geoTime_viewMode`
- Persists across browser sessions

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Mobile View**: Quick clock in/out, GPS location, simplified interface
2. **Full Features**: Complete dashboard, reports, requests, approvals
3. **Toggle Button**: Available in user dropdown menu (mobile/tablet only)
4. **Desktop/Laptop**: Always shows full features (no toggle needed)

### For Developers
```javascript
import { 
  shouldShowMobileView, 
  shouldShowFullView, 
  setUserViewPreference,
  VIEW_MODES 
} from '../utils/deviceDetection';

// Check current view mode
const isMobileView = shouldShowMobileView();
const isFullView = shouldShowFullView();

// Set user preference
setUserViewPreference(VIEW_MODES.MOBILE);
```
