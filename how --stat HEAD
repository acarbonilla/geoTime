    ðŸ”’ SECURITY FIX: Implement role-based exception handling for time validation
    
    - Fix critical security vulnerability allowing validation bypasses
    - Regular employees now blocked on validation errors (fail-safe)
    - Team Leaders can still bypass with proper audit logging
    - Prevents unauthorized early clock-ins (e.g., 02:58 AM for 7:00 AM schedule)
    - Aligns backend security with frontend validation rules
    - Adds proper logging for all bypass attempts
    
    Fixes issue where 1-hour early clock-in rule was being bypassed
